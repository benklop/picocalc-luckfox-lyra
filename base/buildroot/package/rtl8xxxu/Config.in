	  Driver for Realtek 802.11n USB wireless chips, backported from 
	  the Linux mainline kernel with additional improvements and bug fixes.
	  
	  Supported chips include:
	  - RTL8188CU/CUS/CTV, RTL8188EU/EUS/ETV, RTL8188FU/FTV
	  - RTL8188GU, RTL8188RU, RTL8191CU, RTL8192CU
	  - RTL8192EU, RTL8192FU, RTL8723AU, RTL8723BU
	  
	  This driver provides better compatibility and performance compared 
	  to the standard rtl8xxxu driver included in the kernel, with 
	  support for more recent chipsets and additional features.
	  
	  Note: Some RTL8188GU and RTL8192FU adapters may start in "Driver 
	  CDROM Mode" and need to be switched to "Wi-Fi Mode" using 
	  usb_modeswitch or the eject command.
