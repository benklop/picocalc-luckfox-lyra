# TODO List - PicoCalc Lyra Build System

This document tracks known issues, work-in-progress features, and planned improvements for the PicoCalc LuckFox Lyra build system.

## üö® Critical Issues (Not Working)

### Audio System
- [ ] **Stereo hardware PWM audio** - Audio output is not yet fully functional
  - Current DTS configuration exists but driver integration incomplete
  - PWM channels configured in device tree: `pwm0_4ch_0` channels 1 & 2
  - Custom sound card driver (`fsl,picocalc-snd-pwm`) needs work
  - **Priority**: High

### WiFi Connectivity  
- [ ] **RTL8188FU WiFi driver** - Driver builds but WiFi not functional
  - Driver package exists in `base/buildroot/package/rtl8188fu/`
  - Firmware installation configured but may need debugging
  - Kernel configuration requirements may need adjustment
  - **Priority**: High

## üîß Build System Improvements

### USB Flashing
- [ ] **Automatic ADB reboot for flashing** - Use ADB to automatically reboot device into loader mode
  - Currently users must manually run `reboot loader` or use hardware boot button
  - Could detect ADB-connected device and automatically trigger loader mode
  - Would streamline flashing workflow significantly
  - **Priority**: Medium

## üì¶ Package System

### RTL8188FU Driver Package
- [x] ‚úÖ **Package creation** - BuildRoot package exists
- [x] ‚úÖ **Firmware installation** - Configured in package makefile
- [ ] **Driver debugging** - Investigate why WiFi doesn't work
- [ ] **Kernel config validation** - Ensure all required options enabled

### Audio Packages
- [ ] **ALSA utilities** - Add alsa-utils package for audio debugging
- [ ] **Audio testing tools** - Add speaker-test, aplay utilities
- [ ] **Sound card detection** - Verify ALSA can see the PWM sound device

## üñ•Ô∏è System Integration

### Device Tree
- [x] ‚úÖ **Basic hardware support** - SD card, USB, I2C, SPI working
- [x] ‚úÖ **Display support** - ILI9488 LCD working
- [x] ‚úÖ **Keyboard support** - PicoCalc keyboard working  
- [x] ‚úÖ **RTC support** - DS3231 RTC working
- [ ] **Audio pinmux** - Verify PWM audio pins are correctly configured
- [ ] **WiFi power management** - May need additional power/reset GPIO config
- [ ] **Serial terminal on top USB port** - Enable serial console access via upper USB-C port
  - Currently only lower port (Lyra) supports flashing/USB OTG
  - Upper port connected through MCU, could provide serial access
  - Would enable easier debugging without opening device
  - **Priority**: Medium
- [ ] **Terminal font size optimization** - Adjust console font for 320x320 display
  - Current font (6x8) may be too small for the display size
  - Need to find optimal balance between readability and screen real estate
  - Consider fonts like 8x16 or custom bitmap fonts
  - **Priority**: Medium

### Boot Configuration
- [ ] **Document Windows flashing process** - I don't use windows so I can't really test this as easily
- [ ] **Separate /home partition** - Split /home into dedicated partition to preserve user data
  - Currently /home is part of rootfs and gets wiped during firmware updates
  - Would allow firmware updates while preserving user files and configurations
  - Requires modifying partition layout and parameter.txt
  - **Priority**: Medium

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Hardware Testing
- [ ] **WiFi scanning** - Test if RTL8188FU can at least scan networks
- [ ] **Power management** - Test suspend/resume functionality

### Build Testing
- [ ] **Clean build validation** - Test complete clean builds
- [ ] **Package set testing** - Validate package set overlay system
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** - Test on different Linux distributions

## üîå Power Management Integration

### MCU Power Management
- [ ] **MCU firmware modifications** - Extend MCU firmware for power management
  - Add support for detecting short button press events (vs long press that 
    should still be handled by the MCU directly)
  - Implement power state commands (power off at least)
  - Create communication protocol for power management between MCU and Linux
  - **Priority**: High
- [ ] **Linux power management driver** - Create or extend driver for MCU power features
  - Option 1: Integrate into existing keyboard driver (same MCU device)
  - Option 2: Create separate power management driver
  - Handle button press events and translate to Linux power events
  - Implement power state control interface
  - **Priority**: High

## üìö Documentation

### User Documentation
- [x] ‚úÖ **Flashing guide** - Comprehensive FLASHING.md
- [x] ‚úÖ **Build instructions** - Clear README.md
- [x] ‚úÖ **Package development** - Detailed ADDING_PACKAGES.md
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Expand troubleshooting sections
- [ ] **Hardware documentation** - Document GPIO usage, pinout

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] **Device tree reference** - Document custom DT bindings
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Build optimization tips

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Additional Hardware Support
- [ ] **Support LoRA radio** - use a bitbanged SPI interface on the pads below the lyra for this

### Software Features
- [ ] **Package manager** - Add package management for runtime installs

### Build System
- [ ] **Multi-target support** - Support for selecting different hardware variants
    - add/remove RTC from devicetree
    - add/remove Lyra SPI pins from devicetree
    - add/remove/select USB wifi driver
    - add/remove/select PWM audio driver
        - software PWM on one channel
        - hardware pwm on one channel
        - hardware pwm on two channels
