	  A standalone driver for the RTL8188FU USB Wi-Fi adapter.
	  This driver provides support for Realtek RTL8188FU chipset 
	  USB WiFi dongles.

	  Make sure your target kernel has the CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT
	  config option enabled.

	  Note: this package needs a firmware loading mechanism to load
	  the binary blob for the chip to work.
